module-whatis "Description: omegaMap is a program for detecting natural selection and recombination in DNA or RNA sequences. It is based on a model of population genetics and molecular evolution. The signature of natural selection is detected using the dN/dS ratio (which measures the relative excess of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism) and the signature of recombination is detected from the patterns of linkage disequilibrium."
